    <p>Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,</p>
    <p>
      This is just a note to let you know that you have successfully signed up for Tipster! I know this is a big moment, and you might be feeling a bit overwhelmed. Don't worry, I'm emotional about it too.

      If you need an idea where to start, try adding the <a href="#">Chrome extension</a>. It's the fastest way to share cool stuff with your friends. (Oh, and you'll also need some friends.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Already got all that? Then you're all set! You'll be a celebrated internet content maven in no time.
