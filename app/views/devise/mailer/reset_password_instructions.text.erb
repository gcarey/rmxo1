Hi <%= @resource.full_name %>,

A request has been made to change the password on this Tipster account. You can do so by clicking this link:

<%= edit_password_url(@resource, :reset_password_token => @token) %>

If you didn't make this request, no worries. You don't need to do anything. Your password won't be changed unless you want it changed.

Cheers,

Garrett
